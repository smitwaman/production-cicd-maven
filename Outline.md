let's outline the steps to set up a CI/CD pipeline using the mentioned tools:


Before start with our configuration installation system tools for making tools ready appserver 

## üëâ [üíªüõ†Ô∏è](Stage-1-appserver.md)


### 1. Setting up Git for SCM:
- Create a Git repository to host your Java source code.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/smitwaman/production-cicd-maven.git

  ```

### 2. Jenkins Integration:
- Install and configure Jenkins on a server.
- Set up a Jenkins job to pull the source code from the Git repository.
- Configure the job to trigger builds automatically or manually.

### 3. Monitoring Jenkins with Prometheus and Grafana:
- Install Prometheus and Grafana.
- Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Jenkins.
- Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize Jenkins metrics.

### 4. Maven for Code Compilation and Artifact Build:
- Install Maven on the Jenkins server.
- Configure the Jenkins job to use Maven for compiling and building the Java code.
- Specify Maven goals in the Jenkins job configuration.

### 5. SonarQube for Quality Checks:
- Install and configure SonarQube server.
- Integrate SonarQube with Jenkins using the SonarQube Scanner plugin.
- Add a SonarQube analysis step to the Jenkins job to perform code quality checks.

### 6. Jenkins-Gmail for Build Status:
- Configure Jenkins to send email notifications using the Jenkins Email Extension plugin.
- Set up email notifications for build success/failure using a Gmail SMTP server.

### 7. Nexus to Store Artifacts:
- Install and configure Nexus repository manager.
- Configure Jenkins to deploy artifacts to Nexus after a successful build.

### 8. Trivy for OWASP:
- Install Trivy for vulnerability scanning.
- Integrate Trivy into the Jenkins pipeline to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.

### 9. Docker to Create Image and Push to Registry:
- Install Docker on the Jenkins server.
- Use Dockerfile to create Docker images for your Java application.
- Push the Docker images to a Docker registry like Docker Hub or a private registry.

### 10. Deploy Cluster Using Docker Swarm:
- Set up a Docker Swarm cluster.
- Create a Docker Swarm service for your application.
- Update the Jenkins pipeline to deploy the Docker image to the Swarm cluster.

### 11. Monitoring Docker Swarm with Prometheus and Grafana:
- Similar to monitoring Jenkins, configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Docker Swarm.
- Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize Docker Swarm metrics.

### 12. Slack for Alerts:
- Configure Jenkins to send alerts to Slack using the Jenkins Slack Notification plugin.
- Set up alerts for build failures, vulnerabilities, or other important events.

Each step will require specific configurations and scripts tailored to your project and environment. Let me know if you need further details on any specific step!
